 Task:
	choose a website and devise your task and instructions. 
This involves developing a simple task for the person who 
is the subject and writing the sheet you will give them to 
let them know what the task is they are to try to do. You 
also have to consider whether you will prepare any other 
written materials for them (e.g., selected pages from a user's manual). 

 interview guide:
	

questionnaire:
	You should write a short (a page or less) follow up questionnaire 
to go to the user at the end of the test period to capture what you think 
might be important retrospectively. 

consent form:
	You SHOULD have a consent form; it should have a space for 
the subject's name, address, and telephone number.

What should be included in your observations and recommendations? Things like: 
1) Problems users had in using the system and why (differences in interpreting words, instructions, etc.). 
2) Unexpected difficulties in doing the test, and how you might change it. 
3) Insight into what the user expected or needed but did not find. 
4) Points in the process where you were forced to help subjects and why. 
5) Be sure to pinpoint where difficulties arose (e.g. screen layout, documentation, etc.)
