When most people hear “Machine Learning,” they picture a robot: a dependable but‐
ler or a deadly Terminator, depending on who you ask. But Machine Learning is not
just a futuristic fantasy; it’s already here. In fact, it has been around for decades in
some specialized applications, such as Optical Character Recognition (OCR). But the
first ML application that really became mainstream, improving the lives of hundreds
of millions of people, took over the world back in the 1990s: the spam filter. It’s not
exactly a self-aware Skynet, but it does technically qualify as Machine Learning (it has
actually learned so well that you seldom need to flag an email as spam anymore). It
was followed by hundreds of ML applications that now quietly power hundreds of
products and features that you use regularly, from better recommendations to voice
search.
