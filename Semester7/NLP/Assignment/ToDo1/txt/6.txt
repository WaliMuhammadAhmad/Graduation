Your spam filter is a Machine Learning program that, given examples of spam emails
(e.g., flagged by users) and examples of regular (nonspam, also called “ham”) emails,
can learn to flag spam. The examples that the system uses to learn are called the train‐
ing set. Each training example is called a training instance (or sample). In this case, the
task T is to flag spam for new emails, the experience E is the training data, and the
performance measure P needs to be defined; for example, you can use the ratio of
correctly classified emails. This particular performance measure is called accuracy,
and it is often used in classification tasks.
