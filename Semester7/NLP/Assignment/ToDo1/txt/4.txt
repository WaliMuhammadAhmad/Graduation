This chapter introduces a lot of fundamental concepts (and jargon) that every data
scientist should know by heart. It will be a high-level overview (it’s the only chapter
without much code), all rather simple, but you should make sure everything is crystal
clear to you before continuing on to the rest of the book. So grab a coffee and let’s get
started!
